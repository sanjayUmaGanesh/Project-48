            <p>  <h3>Origami (折り紙, Japanese pronunciation: [oɾiɡami] or [oɾiꜜɡami], from ori meaning "folding",

                and kami meaning "paper" (kami changes to gami due to rendaku)) is the art of paper folding,
                which is often associated with Japanese culture. In modern usage, the word "origami" is used
                as an inclusive term for all folding practices, regardless of their culture of origin. The goal is
                to transform a flat square sheet of paper into a finished sculpture through folding and sculpting techniques.
                 Modern origami practitioners generally discourage the use of cuts, glue, or markings on the paper. Origami 
                 folders often use the Japanese word kirigami to refer to designs which use cuts.</h3></p>
                 <br>
            <h3><p>Origami is an japanese art of folding paper into intricate models.The small number of basic origami folds
                can be combined in a variety of ways to make intricate designs.
                The best-known origami model is the Japanese paper crane. In general, these designs begin with a square
                sheet of paper whose sides may be of different colors, prints, or patterns. Traditional Japanese origami,
                which has been practiced since the Edo period (1603–1867), has often been less strict about these
                conventions, sometimes cutting the paper or using nonsquare shapes to start with. The principles of 
                origami are also used in stents, packaging, and other engineering applications</p></h3>
